# Kickstarter Crowdfunding Data Analysis

This project involved analyzing a dataset of 140K crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter using Excel, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau. The goal was to transform and analyze the data to assess project performance, success rates, and funding. Key insights were gathered from the analysis, which can help identify strategies to boost future crowdfunding success.

## Overview

Using various data transformation and visualization tools, we examined key metrics such as total amount raised, project success rates, backer engagement, and trends over time. The analysis highlighted factors contributing to project success, helping to inform best practices for increasing projects success rates.

## Key Features

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Amount Raised for Successful Projects**
- **Average Days to Complete Projects**
- **Total Backers for Successful Projects**
- **Total Number of Projects**

### Project Success & Backer Analysis

- **Category vs. Total Projects**: A breakdown of projects by category to assess which categories had the highest number of projects.
- **Total Projects by Backers Count**: A visualization showing the distribution of projects based on the number of backers, revealing trends in backer engagement.
- **Project Status by State**: Projects are categorized by their status: failed, canceled, successful, or live. This analysis provides insights into the lifecycle and outcomes of crowdfunding campaigns.
- **Total Projects by Country**: A geographic analysis of Kickstarter projects, highlighting the distribution of projects across different countries.
  
### Trends Over Time

- **Amount Raised and Successful Projects by Year**: This analysis tracks how the total amount raised and the number of successful projects have evolved over the years.

### Slicers for Interactive Analysis

- **Category Slicer**: Allows users to filter data based on different project categories, providing insights into which types of projects tend to succeed or fail.
- **Quarter Slicer**: Enables filtering of data based on project launch quarter, offering insights into trends over specific periods.
- **State Slicer**: Provides a way to filter projects based on their state (successful, failed, canceled, or live), allowing for detailed analysis of project performance by outcome.

 ## Overall Observation:

• The data reveals that 38.5% of crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter are successful, collectively raising over $1.35 billion.

• Category trends show that certain types of projects perform better (Comics, Fiction, Fashion), and project creators should consider focusing on these successful categories for higher chances of success.

• Noted that high backer engagement and novelty (e.g., Exploding Kittens, Fidget Cube) drive success, recommending creators focus on these factors.

• Geographic insights show that certain countries are more active in Kickstarter campaigns, highlighting potential focus areas for future campaigns.

• The average time to completion for successful projects indicates that shorter campaigns with clear, urgent goals tend to perform better.

• Annual trends show growth in crowdfunding activity, providing insights for project creators to plan their campaigns more effectively.

• Suggested setting realistic goals based on category, backer size, a data monitoring system to track live projects and detect early signs of potential suspensions or cancellations and past project performance to avoid failure.

• Recommended enhanced backer engagement through social media, updates, and transparent communication to maintain trust.

• Designed educational materials to help creators understand trends and avoid common mistakes leading to project failure.

By leveraging these insights, project creators can adjust their strategies to increase success rates, attract more backers, and ultimately raise more funds for their campaigns.
